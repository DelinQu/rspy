The `core` implementation of [Fast Rolling Shutter Correction in the Wild, TPAMI 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148802) and [Towards Nonlinear-Motion-Aware and Occlusion-Robust Rolling Shutter Correction, ICCV 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18125).

## üöÄ Features
- A light weight library for rolling shutter correction which is easy to use.
- Support linear, qudratic and cubic motion models.
- Support sparse features correction and can be pluged into 3D vision algorithm pipeline, such as SfM, SLAM, etc.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git@github.com:DelinQu/rspy.git
# pip install rspy is unavailable now
```
It's recommended to clone the code and run the demo files in the `rspy` folder. In our implementation, we use [open-mmlab/mmflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmflow) to caculate the optical flow, and please refer to the [installation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmflow/blob/master/docs/en/install.md) for optical flow support.

### Usage

[`rspy`](https://github.com/rspy/rspy/blob/master/rspy) contains `linear`, `quadratic` and `cubic` models for faster rolling shutetr correction. The `solver` is the core of the rspy, which receives the optical flow fields and return the correction field. The `feats_sampling` function warps the RS image back to GS one.

- `gamma`: the ratio of the exposure time to the frame interval.
- `tau`: the normalized timestamp warping to.

</details>


<details>
<summary>1. Linear rolling shutter correction</summary>
<p>

`linear_flow` receives a optical flow field from $I_{0} \to I_{-1}$ and return correction field $u_{0 \to \tau}$.
```python
F0tau = solver(F0n1, gamma, tau)  # * (1,h,w,2)
rsc_image = feats_sampling(rs_image, -F0tau)
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Quadratic rolling shutter correction</summary>
<p>

`quadratic_flow` receives two optical flow fields from $I_{0} \to I_{-1}$ and $I_{0} \to I_{1}$, and return correction field $u_{0 \to \tau}$.
```python
F0tau = solver(F0n1, F01, gamma, tau)  # * (1,h,w,2)
rsc_image = feats_sampling(rs_image, -F0tau)
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Cubic rolling shutter correction</summary>
<p>

`cubic_flow` receives three optical flow fields from $I_{0} \to I_{-2}$, $I_{0} \to I_{-1}$ and $I_{0} \to I_{1}$, and return correction field $u_{0 \to \tau}$.

```python
F0tau = solver(F0n2, F0n1, F01, gamma, tau)  # * (1,h,w,2)
rsc_image = feats_sampling(rs_image, -F0tau)
```
</p>
</details>

## üçÄ Demo
We provided a demo for rolling shutter correction in `rspy`Ôºå which read the images from the `demo` folder and save the results in the `out` folder. The demo can be run by the following command:
```bash
python rspy/demo.py --model=linear

python rspy/demo.py --model=qudratic

python rspy/demo.py --model=cubic
```
You can also use your own images with a sutable `gamma` and `tau` to get a satisfactory result.
