## üöÄ Features
- A light weight library for rolling shutter correction which is easy to use.
- Support linear, qudratic and cubic motion models.
- Support sparse features correction and can be pluged into 3D vision algorithm pipeline, such as SfM, SLAM, etc.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U rspy
```
It's recommended to clone the code and run the demo files in the `rspy` folder. In our implementation, we use [open-mmlab/mmflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmflow) to caculate the optical flow, and please refer to the [installation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmflow/blob/master/docs/en/install.md) for optical flow support.

### Usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/rspy/rspy/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

## üìà Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rspy/rspy/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/rspy/rspy/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.
